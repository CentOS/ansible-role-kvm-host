# Defaults variables for role kvm-host

# Do we also want to manage storage pool for libvirt images ?
# That will create automatically a LV in the first VG and mount it
# Set it to False if you manage manually or you convert from existing node with storage from other VG/raid/volume
# Default to True
kvm_host_manage_storage: True
# If so, defaulting to first VG found, so you can select other one
kvm_host_vg: "{{ ansible_lvm.vgs.keys() | list | first }}"
# Default size for libvirt_images LV storage

# Networking - bridges with vlan support
# That will just create bridge without any ip settings attached to it , so dedicated for VMs
# By default no bridge interface will be created.
# Creating bridge over vlan is working and just need vlan_id specified
# example:
# kvm_host_net_bridges:
#   - name: br0
#     device: eth0
#   - name: br-999
#     device: eth0
#     vlan_id: 999
#     
kvm_host_net_bridges: []
